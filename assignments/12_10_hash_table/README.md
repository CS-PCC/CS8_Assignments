# Hash Table

Generally speaking, hash tables are used to quickly determine whether an element appears in the set.

Three common hash structures:

- array
- set (collection)
- map (mapping)

In C++, both set and map provide three data structures respectively. The underlying implementation and purpose of each data structure is different.

**set:**

- std::set
- std::multiset
- std::unordered_set

**map:**

- std::map
- std::multimap
- std::unordered_map

Only those who are familiar with the underlying implementation of these data structures can use them flexibly, otherwise it is easy to write inefficient programs.
