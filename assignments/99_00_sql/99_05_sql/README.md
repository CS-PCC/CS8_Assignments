# SQL

- Accept [99_05_sql](https://classroom.github.com/a/0ruFe-sk)
- Get [basic_test.cpp](basic_test.cpp)

---

You will combine `parser`, `table`, and `binary_files` together to process SQL commands in this project.

## SQL Class

You need to implement [sql](sql.h) class to process SQL commands in both `string` and `file` as inputs. [SampleInput](_!sample01.txt) is reference to test class.

We should allow user to enter SQL command in command prompt to operate database.
