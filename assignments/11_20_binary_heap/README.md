# Binary Heap

The main application of the binary heap is the priority queue, and the feature of the priority queue is dynamic sorting, and the inserted elements can automatically maintain the correct order. Of course, the binary search tree can also be used for dynamically sorting. The limitation of the priority queue is that elements can only be operated from the head and tail of the queue.

Generally speaking, there are two main types of questions that use priority queues:

  1. Merge multiple sorted linked lists
  2. Find the kth largest element
